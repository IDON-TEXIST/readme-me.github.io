Oh hey
you want to help this repository? great
no i mean it, thats absolutely perfect

ok so for contributing you need to follow a small format to help us organize the repo properly


try to see what folder should your meme go under
* [2015-was-a-cool-year](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/2015-was-a-cool-year)
* [Gaming](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/gaming)
* [hi-simy](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/hi-simy)
* [reactions](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/reactions)
* [relatable](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/relatable)
* [unorganized](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/unorganized)
* [what-the-fuck](https://github.com/readme-me/readme-me.github.io/tree/main/what-the-fuck)
then make sure linking the image is easy

then edit the readme.md and link your image 
the image must be named a number, and the number must be bigger than the biggest number in the folder you're putting the meme in

yea thats simple
