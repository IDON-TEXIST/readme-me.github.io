Oh hey
you want to help this repository? great
no i mean it, thats absolutely perfect
i wanted a friend :)


ok so for contributing you need to follow a small format to help us organize the repo properly


try to see what folder should your meme go under
<insert currently existing folders here -shelf man>
then make sure linking the image is easy

then edit the readme.md and link your image 
the image must be named a number, and the number must be bigger than the biggest number in the folder you're putting the meme in

yea thats simple
